# Example application integrating with Dimmy on-device
This example application demonstrates how you can call a flow in Dimmy and retrieve the results in your own app,
without having to wait for the REST API. See [ContentView.swift](https://github.com/Optioryx/ExampleDimmyIntegratedApp/blob/main/TestAppLinks/ContentView.swift) for sample on-device code and [our REST API docs](https://docs.optioryx.com/docs/dimmy-api/latest/get-items-items-get) for the data schema.
